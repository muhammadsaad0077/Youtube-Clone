  - Features
  - Tech Stack (Technologies used to make required project)

  2nd Step: Planing (How you structure your project)

Debouncing: 
The gap in typing in which you decide wheather the api call should be made or not...

Google debouncing is very less,,, that is it suggest search results on every character... 
FlipKart debouning is large... it suggests reults after the fixed stay of user on any character

Cache:
time complexity to search in array = o(n)   (order of n)
time complexity to search in Object = o(1)   (order of 1)

[
  i, ip, iph, phone
]

This saves time
{
  i:
  ip:
  iph:
  iphone:
}

- API Polling: In this communication data is only send from server to UI, It is unidirectional, In this, server regularly sends the data after regular interval.  (Gmail, CricBuzz;)
